Pathfinding Visualizer

Overview

This project is a Pathfinding Visualizer built with React, showcasing various pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's Algorithm. It provides an interactive interface where users can visualize how algorithms explore and find the shortest path in a grid.

Features

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Visualize the shortest path finding process.
Interactive Grid: Users can place start and end points, draw obstacles, and reset the grid.
Real-Time Visualization: Watch the algorithm step through the grid in real-time.
Responsive Design: Works across various screen sizes.
Getting Started

Prerequisites
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. Download Node.js
Installation
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinding-visualizer.git
cd pathfinding-visualizer
Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Application
After the dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will start on http://localhost:3000/ by default.
Usage
Set Start and End Points: Click on any cell to set the start or end point.
Draw Obstacles: Click and drag to create walls or obstacles that the algorithm must navigate around.
Visualize: Once everything is set, click the "Start" button to visualize the algorithm in action.
Reset: Click the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start again.
Screenshot
Built With

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS: For styling the grid and controls.
Algorithms Included

Dijkstra's Algorithm: The core algorithm used in this visualizer, known for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
